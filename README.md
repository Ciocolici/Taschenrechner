# Taschenrechner
A simple C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. A basic calculator, that can handle basic calculations of: + - * /

*This application has later been remade twice, once as part of [this project](https://github.com/Ciocolici/5-in-1), and once in WinForms in [this project](https://github.com/Ciocolici/Taschenrechner-WinForms).*

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Taschenrechner.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0".*

*Note: german language used.*
